the broadcasr function in fakenet fails because in utxo models, new addresses are created, therefore fakenet loses track of the latest adresses.
when new adresses are created between broadcast for loop and senmesaage call, the for loop executes on the old address, so the send message cannot find the client.

solution: maybe guid for clients
